<!-- Made by [me](https://github.com/kapusuzoglu/). Based on the **awesome** [Hugo Starter Theme with Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/dirkolbrich/hugo-theme-tailwindcss-starter). -->
I received my Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University. My academic journey also includes two M.S. degrees in Computational Engineering and Applied Mathematics from Delft University and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. As a researcher, I lead the development and implementation of novel mathematical algorithms, with a keen focus on addressing uncertainty within models.

My work extends to the exciting realm of hybrid machine learning (ML), where I seamlessly blend different ML techniques with fundamental physics knowledge. One of my proudest achievements lies in creating innovative methods that fuse heuristics and real-world data with ML models. By doing so, I bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications.

Modeling uncertainty is at the heart of my research. I strive to develop multi-objective optimizations that respond effectively to uncertainty, ensuring robust and reliable outcomes. Additionally, I’ve devised strategies for enabling sound management decisions—finding the delicate balance between refining models and generating essential test/validation data.

In this ever-evolving landscape of machine learning, I remain committed to pushing boundaries and contributing to advancements that benefit both academia and industry.
