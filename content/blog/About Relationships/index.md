# Introduction

This post is all about how to navigate open communication and transparency in relationships. It is about life, relationships, responsibilites and commitment. In another word, about EVERYTHING that matters in life!

I will put **[XXX]** for the thing that is the cause of issues in that relationship.

# Partners need to feel heard and respected

## Express Your Feelings
Let your partner know how you feel when he gets mad at you. Use “I” statements to express your feelings without blaming them, such as “I feel upset when you get mad at me for not understanding **[XXX]** quickly.”

## Ask for patience
Learning a new task takes time and everyone learns at their own pace. Ask your partner for patience and understanding as you continue to learn **[XXX]**.

It can be challenging when someone lacks patience, but there are ways to approach this. Here are some suggestions:

1. Choose the Right Time: Find a calm and peaceful moment to discuss this issue. Avoid bringing it up when your partner is already frustrated or upset.

2. Use “I” Statements: Instead of saying “You need to be more patient,” say something like “I feel stressed when I feel rushed. It would help me if we could find a way to slow things down a bit.”

3. Be Specific: Instead of asking for more patience in general, pinpoint specific instances where you’d like him to be more patient, such as when you’re learning **[XXX]** or in the mornings when you’re not at your best.

4. Express Understanding: Acknowledge that it might be frustrating for him too. This can show him that you understand his feelings as well.

5. Suggest Alternatives: If there are things that he gets impatient about that you can do on your own, suggest that you do these things independently. This might be studying/doing **[XXX]**, for example.


For some people it can be difficult to express their feelings, especially when it comes to acknowledging our own challenges. There are couple of ways to approach this:

- Write a Letter: If verbal communication is challenging, consider writing a letter to your partner. This allows you to organize your thoughts and express your feelings without interruption.

- Use Analogies: Sometimes, using an analogy can help convey your point. For example, you could say, “Learning **[XXX]** for me is like learning to play a musical instrument. It takes time and practice, and everyone progresses at their own pace.”

- Positive Reinforcement: Start the conversation on a positive note. Appreciate his efforts in teaching you Turkish and express your desire to learn and improve.


## Compromise on morning routines
Every person has different morning energy levels. It can be challenging to live with someone that is completely different than yourself when it comes to morning routines. In that case it is often a good idea to try to find a compromise that works for both of you. 

## Share interests
Try to find a balance between your interests, your partner’s interests, and your responsibilities. Maybe you can set aside some time to engage in his interests together.
