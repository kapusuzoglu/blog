# Education

## Vanderbilt University | <location> Nashville, TN, USA </location> --> <time> Aug. 2017 - Mar. 2022 </time>
- Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (GPA: 3.88)
- **Thesis title**: [Physics-informed machine learning for uncertainty quantification and optimization](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/17358)
    - Explored the integration of physics-based models and experimental data to craft diverse physics-informed machine learning models. These models, designed for optimization under uncertainty, achieved a remarkable **300x reduction in computational effort** while preserving accuracy.
    - Spearheaded the development of adaptive sampling and multi-level Bayesian calibration strategies. These advancements were applied to a complex multivariate time-dependent multi-component system, resulting in a noteworthy enhancement of computational efficiency and accuracy by a factor of **120** and **16%**, respectively.

## Delft University of Technology | <location> Delft, The Netherlands </location> --> <time> July 2015 - Nov. 2016 </time>
